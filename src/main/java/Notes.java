    What is a database
    - An organized collection of structured information or data

    The difference between a database and a spreadsheet

    Types of databases
    Object-oriented databases
    -Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

    Distributed databases
    - A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers,
     located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.
    Data warehouses
    - A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.
    NoSQL databases
    -A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database,
     which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.
    Graph databases
    - A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.
    OLTP databases.
    - An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.
    Open source databases
    - An open source database system is one whose source code is open source; such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.
    Cloud databases
    - A cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform.
    There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.
    Multimodel database
    - Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end. This means they can accommodate various data types.
    Document/JSON database
    Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.
    Self-driving databases
    The newest and most groundbreaking type of database, self-driving databases (also known as autonomous databases) are cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning,
    security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by database administrators.
    database Managment system
    - A database serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized.
     A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.

     Some examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL,
     Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.

     MYSQL database
    - MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL.
     created to optimized for web applications and can run on any platform.

     - MySQL is the DBMS behind some of the top websites and web-based applications in the world,
     including Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
